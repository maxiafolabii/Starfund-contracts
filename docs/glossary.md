# StarFund Escrow — Glossary

Cross-team reference (legal, product, engineering) for terms used in the
on-chain contract, off-chain indexers, and user-facing copy.

All status values refer to `InvoiceEscrow.status` stored under
`DataKey::Escrow` in `escrow/src/lib.rs`.

---

## Invoice lifecycle status codes

| `status` | Name | Meaning | Allowed next status |
|----------|------|---------|---------------------|
| `0` | **Open** | Escrow initialised; accepting investor funding. | `1` (funded) |
| `1` | **Funded** | `funded_amount >= funding_target`; SME may withdraw or settle. | `2` (settled) or `3` (withdrawn) |
| `2` | **Settled** | SME called `settle` after maturity; investors may record payout claims. | — terminal |
| `3` | **Withdrawn** | SME called `withdraw`; liquidity pulled. No further settlement possible. | — terminal |

Transitions are **strictly forward**. No entrypoint moves `status` backward.
`settle` and `withdraw` are mutually exclusive paths from `funded` (both
require `status == 1`). See [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-state-model.md).

**Terminal states:** `settled` (2) and `withdrawn` (3). Only terminal escrows
may have dust swept by the treasury (`sweep_terminal_dust`).

## Roles

### Admin
The Stellar address supplied at `init`. Controls governance-level operations:
setting/clearing legal hold, binding attestation hashes, updating maturity or
funding target (open state only), and transferring admin to a new address.

Production deployments should use a **multisig or governed contract** as admin
so that legal holds cannot be used for indefinite fund lock without off-chain
governance recovery. See [ADR-004](adr/ADR-004-legal-hold.md).

### SME (Small and Medium Enterprise)
The invoice originator. Receives stablecoin liquidity when the escrow is
funded (`withdraw`) and is responsible for calling `settle` after the invoice
matures. The SME address is set at `init` and cannot be changed.

### Investor
Any Stellar address that contributes principal via `fund` or
`fund_with_commitment`. Investors record a payout claim via
`claim_investor_payout` after the escrow is settled. Each investor's
contribution is stored under `DataKey::InvestorContribution(Address)`.

### Treasury
The protocol treasury address bound immutably at `init`. The only recipient of
`sweep_terminal_dust`. Must authorise dust-sweep calls. Cannot be changed after
deploy.

---

## Core terms

### Invoice escrow
A single deployed instance of the `StarfundEscrow` contract that holds
investor funds for one tokenised invoice until settlement. Each instance binds
exactly one funding token, one SME, one treasury, and one admin.

### Invoice ID (`invoice_id`)
An ASCII alphanumeric + underscore identifier (max 32 chars) supplied at `init`
and stored as a Soroban `Symbol`. Must align with off-chain invoice slugs so
indexers remain unambiguous.

### Funding token
The SEP-41-compliant stablecoin contract bound at `init` under
`DataKey::FundingToken`. Immutable after deploy. Fee-on-transfer, rebasing, and
hook tokens are **explicitly out of scope** — see
[Token integration security](#token-integration-security) below.

### Funding target
`InvoiceEscrow.funding_target` — the principal amount (in token base units)
that must be reached for the escrow to transition from open → funded. Defaults
to `amount` at `init`; may be updated by admin while status is open.

### Funded amount
`InvoiceEscrow.funded_amount` — running total of principal credited across all
`fund` / `fund_with_commitment` calls. Incremented with `checked_add` to
prevent overflow.

### Maturity
`InvoiceEscrow.maturity` — a ledger timestamp (Unix seconds, validator-observed)
before which `settle` is blocked. `0` means no maturity gate. Enforced as
`ledger.timestamp() >= maturity` (inclusive). Updatable by admin while open.

### Yield (basis points)
`InvoiceEscrow.yield_bps` — the base annualised yield for this invoice in
integer basis points (`0–10 000`). Used as the floor for tiered yield
selection. Coupon arithmetic is performed **off-chain**; the contract stores
the rate only.

### Tiered yield / commitment lock
Optional ladder of `YieldTier { min_lock_secs, yield_bps }` set at `init` and
stored immutably under `DataKey::YieldTierTable`. An investor who calls
`fund_with_commitment` on their **first** deposit selects the best matching
tier; their effective rate is stored under
`DataKey::InvestorEffectiveYield(Address)`. Follow-on deposits must use `fund`.
If `committed_lock_secs > 0`, `DataKey::InvestorClaimNotBefore(Address)` is
set to `ledger.timestamp() + committed_lock_secs`, gating `claim_investor_payout`.
See [ADR-005](adr/ADR-005-tiered-yield.md).

### Funding-close snapshot
`FundingCloseSnapshot` written once, atomically, on the first transition to
`status == 1`. Contains `total_principal` (including overfunding past target),
`funding_target`, ledger timestamp, and sequence. **Immutable** thereafter.
Off-chain pro-rata share for an investor:
`get_contribution(addr) / snapshot.total_principal`. See
[ADR-003](adr/ADR-003-settlement-flow.md).

### Payout claim
An idempotency marker (`DataKey::InvestorClaimed(Address) = true`) set when an
investor calls `claim_investor_payout` after `status == 2`. The contract does
**not** transfer tokens; the integration layer handles actual payout using the
snapshot and contribution data.

### Legal / compliance hold
A boolean flag (`DataKey::LegalHold`) set by admin via `set_legal_hold`. While
active it blocks `settle`, `withdraw`, `claim_investor_payout`, and
`sweep_terminal_dust`. Cleared by the same admin path. See
[ADR-004](adr/ADR-004-legal-hold.md).

### Collateral commitment
`SmeCollateralCommitment` — a **ledger record only**. The SME may call
`record_sme_collateral_commitment` to log an asset symbol, amount, and
timestamp. This does **not** custody collateral, freeze tokens, or trigger
liquidation. It is metadata for transparency and indexing. The
`batch_record_collateral` entrypoint provides atomic batch processing of
multiple collateral commitments.

### Attestation
Two complementary audit mechanisms, both admin-only:

- **Primary attestation hash** (`DataKey::PrimaryAttestationHash`): a single
  32-byte digest (e.g. SHA-256 of a KYC/legal bundle). Single-set; cannot be
  overwritten.
- **Attestation append log** (`DataKey::AttestationAppendLog`): a bounded
  append-only list of digests (max `MAX_ATTESTATION_APPEND_ENTRIES = 32`) for
  versioned or incremental updates.

### Terminal dust sweep
`sweep_terminal_dust` moves at most `MAX_DUST_SWEEP_AMOUNT = 100 000 000` base
units of the funding token from the contract to the treasury per call. Only
permitted in terminal states (`status == 2` or `3`), blocked by legal hold,
and requires treasury auth. Intended for rounding residue — not for settling
live liabilities.

### Schema version
`SCHEMA_VERSION` (currently `6`) written to `DataKey::Version` at `init`. Used
to gate the `migrate` entrypoint. See the
[schema version changelog](../README.md#schema-version-changelog-datakeyversion).

## Token integration security

The following assumptions apply to the funding token. Violations cause
safe-failure panics at the balance-check boundary in `external_calls.rs`.

| Assumption | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| SEP-41 compliant | Standard `transfer` semantics; sender decreases and recipient increases by exactly `amount`. |
| No fee-on-transfer | Post-transfer balance deltas must equal the requested amount on both sides. |
| No rebasing | Token balances must not change outside of explicit transfers. |
| No hook / callback tokens | Soroban does not allow classic EVM-style re-entrancy, but adversarial token logic is still out of scope. |

See [`docs/ESCROW_TOKEN_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`](ESCROW_TOKEN_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md)
for the full integration checklist.

---

## Out of scope

- **Token economics / coupon calculation** — yield values are stored as integer
  basis points; all coupon arithmetic is off-chain.
- **Collateral enforcement** — `record_sme_collateral_commitment` is a metadata
  record only; no on-chain liquidation is triggered.
- **Registry authority** — `DataKey::RegistryRef` is a discoverability hint for
  indexers; it is not an on-chain authority. Query the registry contract
  directly to verify membership.
- **Sybil resistance** — `UniqueFunderCount` / `MaxUniqueInvestorsCap` limit
  distinct chain accounts, not real-world persons.
- **Wall-clock time** — maturity and claim locks use validator-observed ledger
  timestamps (`Env::ledger().timestamp()`), not an external oracle.
