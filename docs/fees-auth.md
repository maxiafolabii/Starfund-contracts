# Fees: authorization and access rules

Documents **who** may configure or realize the protocol fee, **when**, and **what happens on
rejection** — for auditors, integrators, and reviewers. Verified directly against
`escrow/src/lib.rs` (line references below); this is not a design proposal.

> **Scope:** "fees" in this contract means exactly one thing — the immutable
> `protocol_fee_bps` split applied to the SME's principal at
> [`StarfundEscrow::withdraw`]. There is currently **no entrypoint that changes
> `protocol_fee_bps` after `init`** — see [No update path](#no-update-path-by-design) below.

## Roles

| Role | Fee-related capability |
|------|------------------------|
| **Admin** | Sets `protocol_fee_bps` once, at `init`, as part of creating the escrow. No other fee-related power. |
| **SME** (`sme_address`) | Triggers fee *realization* by calling `withdraw`. Does not choose or see the fee rate change — it was fixed at `init`. |
| **Treasury** | Passive recipient of the fee transfer inside `withdraw`. **Does not authorize anything on this path** — see [Treasury is not authorized here](#treasury-is-not-authorized-on-the-withdraw-path). |
| **Investor** | No interaction with fees at all. Settlement (`settle`), claims (`claim_investor_payout`), and refunds (`refund`) never apply or reference `protocol_fee_bps`. |

---

## Entrypoints

### `init` — configures the fee (admin-authorized)

`escrow/src/lib.rs:1807` (`pub fn init`), fee handling at `1826`, `1841`–`1848`.

- **Auth:** `admin.require_auth()` (`lib.rs:1828`) — the same single authorization that gates the
  entire `init` call; there is no fee-specific auth check separate from this.
- **Parameter:** `protocol_fee_bps: Option<i64>`. `None` defaults to `0` (no fee).
- **Validation:** must satisfy `0..=10_000` (basis points), the same envelope as `yield_bps`.
  `10_000` is a legal value — it routes the entire `funded_amount` to the treasury.
- **Rejection:** value outside `0..=10_000` → `EscrowError::ProtocolFeeBpsOutOfRange` (**215**),
  before any storage write. A caller that isn't `admin` fails Soroban's host-level authorization
  check (`Error(Auth, InvalidAction)`) — **not** a typed `EscrowError` — and no part of `init`
  (including the fee write) executes; see [ADR-002](adr/ADR-002-auth-boundaries.md) on why typed
  errors and auth failures are distinct failure classes.
- **Effect:** `protocol_fee_bps` (or `0`) is written once to `DataKey::ProtocolFeeBps` and never
  read-modified again by any other entrypoint.

### `withdraw` — realizes the fee (SME-authorized)

`escrow/src/lib.rs:4371` (`pub fn withdraw`).

- **Auth:** `escrow.sme_address.require_auth()`, via the shared helper `load_escrow_require_sme`
  (`lib.rs:2299`). Admin, investor, and treasury cannot call `withdraw`.
- **Guard order** (read-only checks before auth, storage writes only after all checks pass):

  | # | Check | On failure |
  |---|-------|------------|
  | 1 | Operational pause inactive | `PausedBlocksWithdrawal` (212) |
  | 2 | Legal hold inactive | `LegalHoldBlocksWithdrawal` (123) |
  | 3 | **`sme_address.require_auth()`** | host-level auth failure (not a typed code) |
  | 4 | `status == 1` (funded) | `WithdrawalNotFunded` (124) |
  | 5 | Contract token balance `>= funded_amount` | `InsufficientContractBalance` (165) |
  | 6 | `fee = funded_amount * fee_bps / 10_000` (checked, floor) | `WithdrawFeeArithmeticOverflow` (216) |
  | 7 | `net = funded_amount - fee` (checked) | `WithdrawNetArithmeticUnderflow` (217) — see note below |

  Checks 1–2 are read-only and run **before** the SME authorization call, so an unauthorized
  caller cannot even learn whether the escrow is paused/held from this call's failure mode
  ordering advantage — but note check 3 itself still fails independently of 4–7 regardless of
  fee configuration.

  **Note on 217 (`WithdrawNetArithmeticUnderflow`):** with `fee_bps` validated to `0..=10_000` at
  `init`, `fee` can never exceed `funded_amount`, so this underflow is **unreachable in practice**
  today. It exists as a defensive guard (checked arithmetic on principle, not because a live input
  can trigger it) rather than a reachable rejection path — do not design integration tests
  expecting to hit it under normal configuration.

- **Effect on success:** `status` → `3` (withdrawn, terminal); `DistributedPrincipal` increases by
  the **full gross** `funded_amount` (fee + net combined) so liability accounting stays correct
  regardless of the split; `fee` transfers to treasury (skipped entirely when `fee == 0` — no
  transfer call is made, preserving the pre-fee gas profile); `net` transfers to `sme_address`.
  Emits [`SmeWithdrew`](#event-smewithdrew).

### `get_protocol_fee_bps` — reads the configured rate (unauthenticated)

`escrow/src/lib.rs:2397`.

- **Auth:** none — pure read, callable by anyone, no state mutation.
- **Returns:** `0` for escrows created before this field existed (additive-key default per
  [ADR-007](adr/ADR-007-storage-key-evolution.md)) or for escrows where `protocol_fee_bps` was
  never supplied at `init`.

---

## No update path (by design)

Unlike `MaxUniqueInvestorsCap`, `MaxPerInvestorCap`, and `MinContributionFloor` — each of which has
a dedicated admin `raise_*`/`lower_*` entrypoint — **`protocol_fee_bps` has no setter of any kind**
after `init`. There is no `set_protocol_fee_bps`, no `raise_protocol_fee_bps`, nothing. Once an
escrow is created, its fee rate for the life of that instance is exactly what `init` recorded.

If you are reading this alongside a PR or branch that adds such a setter: that is a **separate,
additive change** to the authorization surface documented here, not a correction of it. This
document reflects the fee model as implemented on `main` at the time of writing (commit
`e2eaacd`).

## Treasury is not authorized on the withdraw path

The treasury address only appears in `withdraw` as a **payment destination** —
`Self::treasury_or_fail(&env)` (`lib.rs:1676`) reads the stored address with no `require_auth()`
call attached. This is intentional and matches normal payment semantics (a recipient doesn't need
to authorize receiving funds), but it is easy to conflate with
[`sweep_terminal_dust`](escrow-token-safety.md), a *different* entrypoint where the treasury **is**
the caller and **does** authorize (`treasury.require_auth()`). Do not assume "treasury involved" ⇒
"treasury authorized" — check the specific entrypoint.

## Event: `SmeWithdrew`

`escrow/src/lib.rs:1382` (`pub struct SmeWithdrew`). Emitted exactly once per successful `withdraw`, after both transfers
complete.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `name` (topic) | `Symbol` | `"sme_wd"` |
| `invoice_id` (topic) | `Symbol` | The escrow's invoice identifier |
| `amount` | `i128` | **Net** amount transferred to the SME (`funded_amount - fee`) — not the gross `funded_amount` |
| `recipient` | `Address` | The `sme_address` that received `amount` |
| `fee` | `i128` | Protocol fee transferred to treasury (`0` when `protocol_fee_bps == 0`) |

Indexers reconstructing gross principal must compute `amount + fee`, not read `amount` alone.

---

## Worked example

Escrow created with `funded_amount = 1,000,000` (base units) at withdrawal time.

| `protocol_fee_bps` | `fee` (`funded × bps ÷ 10 000`, floor) | `net` to SME | Treasury transfer made? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0` (default / unset) | `0` | `1,000,000` | No — zero-fee path skips the treasury call entirely |
| `250` (2.5%) | `25,000` | `975,000` | Yes |
| `10,000` (100%) | `1,000,000` | `0` | Yes — SME transfer is skipped (`net == 0`), only treasury is paid |

**Rounding example** showing the floor favors the SME: `funded_amount = 1,000`, `protocol_fee_bps =
333` (3.33%): `fee = 1000 × 333 ÷ 10 000 = 33.3 → 33` (floored). `net = 967`. The `0.3` unit of
sub-basis-point residue stays with the SME; the treasury is never over-charged by rounding.

**Conservation invariant** (holds for every successful `withdraw`, verified by
`checked_add`/`checked_sub` at every step): `net + fee == funded_amount`, exactly, with no principal
created or destroyed by the split.
